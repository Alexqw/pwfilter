pwfilter is written assuming a POSIX compliant Bourne shell with additional
support for the keyword `local` for variable scoping. It also requires the
POSIX utility `cat` and the non-POSIX /dev/stdin device file. Nearly all *nixes
should have at least one shell that can run pwfilter.

== Shells Known To Work
- sh (some modern variants. e.g. FreeBSD's sh)
- ash (including busybox's)
- bash
- dash
- ksh88
- lksh
- mksh
- pdksh
- posh
- zsh

== Bourne Shells Known To Not Work
- sh (the original AT&T sh)
  - does not have support for the `local` keyword
- ksh93
  - does not have support for the `local` keyword. It /does/ support `typeset`,
    but typeset does not scope variables locally unless functions are written as
    "function foo { }" rather than "foo() { }". The former syntax is non-POSIX
    and causes dash (and I assume other shells too) to choke. Thus, adjusting
    the function declaration and a simple "alias local=typeset" will not work.

== Shells Which Will Never Be Supported
This should go without saying, but given that pwfilter is written using Bourne
shell syntax, it will never be able to run in non-Bourne shells. This includes
the C shell family (csh, tcsh) and any "exotic" shells like fish.

== Operating System Notes
Not sure which shell to use? Chances are good on a modern system that the
default (/bin/sh) will point to a sane and compatible shell.

  *BSD and Linux
    - the default /bin/sh nearly always works
    - dash is quite fast; if you have a choice, use it
    - otherwise, there are many others available via the package manager
  Solaris 10:
    - /bin/ksh (which is ksh88) and /bin/bash will work
  Solaris 11:
    - /bin/bash (or ksh88 if installed, though it isn't available by default)
  Other SunOS (Illumos, OmniOS, etc)
    - /bin/bash or many others available via the package manager
  OS X
    - /bin/sh points to bash
  HP-UX:
    - does not provide /dev/stdin. Either create a named-pipe at that location
      or avoid piping input into pwfilter.

== Man Page
pwfilter's man page is written using mdoc (which is largely based off of roff).
Most modern unices, with the exception of Solaris, have support to correctly
display mdoc man pages.
