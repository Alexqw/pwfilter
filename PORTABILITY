pwfilter is written in POSIX compliant Bourne shell. It also requires the POSIX
utility `cat` and the non-POSIX /dev/stdin device file. Nearly all *nixes should
be able to run pwfilter.

== Shells Known To Work
- sh (old AT&T sh and modern variants. e.g. FreeBSD's sh)
- ash (including busybox's)
- bash
- dash
- ksh88
- ksh93
- lksh
- mksh
- pdksh
- posh
- zsh

== Shells Which Will Never Be Supported
This should go without saying, but given that pwfilter is written using Bourne
shell syntax, it will never be able to run in non-Bourne shells. This includes
the C shell family (csh, tcsh) and any "exotic" shells like fish.

== Portability Notes
Chances are good that the default (/bin/sh) will point to a compatible shell.
Though, if you have a choice, I recommend dash; it is sane and /very/ fast.

Some older, commercial *nixes (HP-UX, some versions of IRIX, and possibly
others) do not provide the /dev/stdin device file. Either create a named-pipe at
that location (with `mkfifo`) or just avoid piping input into pwfilter and rely
on the --file option for your non-system-default needs.

== Man Page
pwfilter's man page is written using mdoc (which is largely based off of roff).
Most modern *nixes, with the exception of Solaris, have support to correctly
display mdoc man pages.
